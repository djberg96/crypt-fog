== Description
  The crypt-fog library is a simple encryption mechanism, but slightly better
  than Rot13. Its primary goal is to provide a reasonable amount of
  obfuscation without having to resort to public/private key exchanges, etc.

  For hyper-sensitive data I recommend using a more advanced encryption scheme.

  In addition to the module, a stand-alone program is included called
  "fogenc" that takes both a string and a number as arguments and returns
  your encrypted string. You can then copy/paste that string to a .rc file.
  Just remember the number you picked in order to decrypt it.

  Usage: fogenc -s "hello" -d 1688
         fogenc -f "test.txt" -d 1066
          
  Modify the shebang line as needed.
          
== Installation
  gem install crypt-fog

== Synopsis
  require 'crypt/fog'
  include Crypt

  s = Fog.new("hello",2003)
  p s # ";8??B"
  p s.decrypt # "hello"

  Fog.decrypt(";8??B",2003) # "hello"

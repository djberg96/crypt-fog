== Description
   The crypt-fog library is a simple encryption mechanism, but slightly better
   than Rot13. Its primary goal is to provide a reasonable amount of
   obfuscation without having to resort to public/private key exchanges, etc.

   For hyper-sensitive data I recommend using a more advanced encryption
   scheme.

   In addition to the module, a stand-alone program is included called
   "fogenc" that takes both a string and a number as arguments and returns
   your encrypted string. You can then copy/paste that string to a .rc file.
   Just remember the number you picked in order to decrypt it.

   Usage: fogenc -s "hello" -d 1688
          fogenc -f "test.txt" -d 1066
          
   Modify the shebang line as needed.
          
== Installation
=== Gem Installation
   gem install crypt-fog

=== Standard Installation
   rake install
   
== Synopsis
   require 'crypt/fog'
   include Crypt

   s = Fog.new("hello",2003)
   p s # ";8??B"
   p s.decrypt # "hello"

   Fog.decrypt(";8??B",2003) # "hello"

== Constants
VERSION
   The current version of the library, returned as a String.

== Class Methods
Fog.new(string, degree=13)
   Creates and returns a new Fog object, which is your obfuscated string.
   The degree is the value used to obfuscate the string.

   Do not be fooled by the default +degree+ value. It is NOT using standard
   rotation encryption.

Fog.decrypt(string, degree=13)
   Returns a (presumably) decrypted String. This method can be used
   when the string comes from an external source.

== Instance Methods
Fog#decrypt
   Returns a decrypted String, using the degree that was provided during
   initialization.
